<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Author of the following Tract
cannot hope that he has said any thing new upon this important
subject; but having had occasion to consider the objections
usually made by young persons, to excuse their non-attendance on
this sacred ordinance, he trusts he has been able to place the
answers to those objections in a new point of view, and to
compress in a few pages, what his reading and memory supplied
from various sources.</p>
<p>The Letter, as it purports to have been, was written to a
gentleman, who had expressed to the Author many of the scruples
here obviated; and by the strong solicitation of two or three
respectable friends, who were of opinion that it was calculated
to do much good, he was induced to give it a more extensive
circulation.&nbsp; That much good has been done by the
publication of this little Tract the Author has the comfort and
satisfaction of knowing upon undoubted testimony.&nbsp; And when
<a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>his
Bookseller informs him, that in a period of less than nine months
the whole of the first impression, consisting of three thousand
copies, has been disposed of, may he not be allowed to hope that
it has done much more extensive good than can possibly be known?
<a name="citation4a"></a><a href="#footnote4a"
class="citation">[4a]</a>&nbsp; The Author, therefore, though a
Layman, and though to the clergy is more peculiarly committed the
charge of bringing men to the love and obedience of Jesus Christ,
trusts he is not offending against the respect and reverence due
to their sacred function and ministry, if &ldquo;with Christian
solicitude, seizing every opportunity which his station affords
him of strengthening others in genuine faith, and of upholding
and advancing them in holiness,&rdquo; <a
name="citation4b"></a><a href="#footnote4b"
class="citation">[4b]</a> he sends forth a second large and
improved edition of a Tract, for which there has been so great a
demand.</p>

EARNEST EXHORTATION,<br />
<span class="GutSmall">&amp;c.</span></h2>
<p><span class="GutSmall">DEAR SIR,</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> made you a solemn promise
upon a most important subject, I proceed to discharge it in the
best manner I am able.&nbsp; Had not this promise been made to
one whose best interests I have so much at heart, I should regret
my having given it, from a conscious inability to perform it as
the subject deserved.&nbsp; But I know you will excuse the
performance, and I humbly trust that it will be attended with the
desired effect.</p>
<p>Of the importance of the duty of receiving the sacrament of
the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, no man, who believes, as you do, the
Scriptures to be the revealed word of God, and that it is our
duty to practise whatever they have <i>expressly</i> and
<i>positively</i> commanded, will require any arguments to be
convinced.&nbsp; Now, no command can be more express than that,
which requires <i>all</i> Christians to receive the communion of
the body and blood of Christ.&nbsp; In the institution of this
holy communion, our <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>blessed Lord says, &ldquo;Take, eat, this is my body,
which is given for you: <i>this do</i>, in remembrance of
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he also said, &ldquo;Drink ye <i>all</i> of
this cup, for this is my blood of the New Testament, which is
shed for many for the remission of sins; <i>this do ye</i>, <i>as
oft as ye drink it</i>, in remembrance of me.&rdquo; <a
name="citation6a"></a><a href="#footnote6a"
class="citation">[6a]</a>&nbsp; And the great Apostle of the
Gentiles, in giving an account of this sacred rite to his
Corinthian converts, and which he expressly states himself to
have received (by tradition or communication <a
name="citation6b"></a><a href="#footnote6b"
class="citation">[6b]</a>) of the Lord, and which, as he received
it, so he delivered to them, adds, &ldquo;<i>For as often as ye
eat this bread</i>, <i>and drink this cup</i>, <i>ye do show</i>
(or, as it is in the original, <i>declare aloud</i>, or
<i>proclaim</i>) <i>the Lord&rsquo;s death till he
comes</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation6c"></a><a href="#footnote6c"
class="citation">[6c]</a>&nbsp; This is the command; and it
surely must be admitted to be an express injunction.</p>
<p>What <i>benefits</i>, then, may we not humbly expect to derive
from our obedience to it?&nbsp; The same divine word has assured
us, that our souls shall be thereby strengthened against the
commission of future sins; and that those which we have
committed, if repented of and renounced, shall be no more
remembered against us: &ldquo;For whosoever,&rdquo; saith the
Redeemer of mankind, &ldquo;eateth my flesh, <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>and drinketh my
blood, hath eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last
day.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a name="citation7a"></a><a href="#footnote7a"
class="citation">[7a]</a>&nbsp; Hear also his own tremendous
declaration!&nbsp; HE has said, and has introduced the
declaration by two asseverations of the certainty of the
denunciation: &ldquo;Verily, verily, I say unto you, except ye
eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his blood, ye have no
life in you.&rdquo; <a name="citation7b"></a><a
href="#footnote7b" class="citation">[7b]</a>&nbsp; What
<i>dangers</i>, then, may we not apprehend, if we disobey this
command! and under what awful sanctions has our Saviour bound us
to the observance of it!&nbsp; This is a solemn and an awful
warning: and it might be thought, if sad experience did not prove
the contrary, that when such blessings follow the performance,
and such dangers may attend the neglect of this positive duty,
nothing more need be said to ensure the obedience, and awaken the
fears of every one, who professes to believe in the truths of
revelation.&nbsp; To a man of an ingenuous mind and a tender
heart, the <i>time</i> and <i>manner</i> of instituting this
sacred rite furnish a most powerful motive to obedience.&nbsp; A
very short time before his death, our blessed Lord had a most
affecting interview with his disciples: he confirms their faith;
he prepares them for the trials they were to endure; he animates
their hopes by the promise of assistance from above; and finally,
commends them to his Father in strains of the <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>most pure and
sublime devotion. <a name="citation8"></a><a href="#footnote8"
class="citation">[8]</a>&nbsp; It was in this most interesting
moment, that he instituted this holy feast to be the harbinger of
peace to the returning sinner, and the consolation of the
faithful to the end of time: and, as an additional incitement to
the performance of it, he was pleased to command, <i>that all
this should be done in remembrance of him</i>.</p>
<p>Supposing we derived no benefit to ourselves from this
Sacrament, as the means of grace, what heart that is not dead to
every virtuous feeling, could refuse to comply with this command,
as a mere act of gratitude to such a Saviour! to Him, who was
moved with such compassion for the sons of men, as to leave the
glories of Heaven, and to take <i>our nature</i> upon him, to
make satisfaction <i>in that nature</i> for our sins?&nbsp; It
was at that awful moment, when, <i>as Man</i>, his soul was
exceedingly sorrowful, on account of the heavy burden of
<i>our</i> sins, then lying upon him, that our dying Saviour
graciously bequeathed this holy ordinance, to distinguish all his
faithful followers, requiring <i>them</i> and <i>all</i>, who
expect any benefit from his death, to commemorate it after the
manner which he has ordained.&nbsp; When it is recollected, that
all this happened the very night <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>before our gracious and affectionate
Redeemer <i>was bruised for our iniquities</i>, <i>and expired
upon the cross for our transgressions</i>, can <i>any</i>
Christian profess that he loves his Saviour, and that he is
grateful for his bitter sufferings, and yet <i>wantonly</i> and
<i>continually</i> turn his back upon this sacred feast,
instituted at a time and under circumstances so peculiarly
affecting?</p>
<p>But as I am addressing one, who professes to be a Christian, I
expect to be told, that you know that Christ has given this
command, that you are assured of the benefits to be derived from
obedience, and aware of the punishment denounced against
disobedience.&nbsp; If you know all these things, do, my dear
friend, consider, that to know what is right, and <i>wilfully</i>
and <i>repeatedly</i> to err against that knowledge, is the very
highest pitch of criminality: and let me conjure you also to
remember, <i>who</i> it is that has said, <i>that the servant who
knew his Lord&rsquo;s will</i>, <i>and did it not</i>, <i>shall
be beaten with many stripes</i>.</p>
<p>I am willing, however, to believe that <i>you</i> have
hitherto been restrained from attending the holy altar, from an
apprehension that your life has not been answerable to what you
conceive it ought to be, in order to a worthy reception of the
body and blood of Christ: and you stifle the suggestions of your
conscience with flattering hopes, that you may live to be more
worthy, and that you may yet have, after your course of life
shall have become <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>more conformable to the dictates of the Gospel, many
opportunities of communicating.</p>
<p>This is the difficulty I undertook to obviate; and always
supposing myself to be addressing a Christian, I think I shall
find it no difficult task.&nbsp; Let us examine this matter, and
begin with the hopes you have expressed, that you shall yet have
many opportunities of worthily communicating.&nbsp; I trust that
you will have many; but what will be the dreadful consequence,
should you die before you have embraced any of those which have
been presented to you, of giving this testimony of your
obedience, love, and gratitude, and wholly destitute of those
graces and blessings which the devout performance of this duty is
so well calculated to produce and to secure?&nbsp; You must also,
I should hope <i>sorrowfully</i>, recollect how many
opportunities have already been graciously vouchsafed to you, how
many invitations (at least twelve or fifteen in every year) <a
name="citation10"></a><a href="#footnote10"
class="citation">[10]</a> have been given, which you have
hitherto <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>neglected; and considering how much is to be done in a
short time, for the attainment of heaven, the best of us have no
opportunities to spare; for who can tell but the <i>next</i> may
be the <i>last</i> afforded to us?</p>
<p>If the sacred rite now insisted upon, were merely
commemorative of the death of our beloved and crucified Saviour,
such a plea as this, must still subject those who urge it, to the
charge of base ingratitude: but when it is considered, as it
truly is, as the best means of grace bestowed by a merciful God
upon a sinful world, the continued neglect of it must also brand
us with the grossest stupidity, folly, and self-destruction.</p>
<p>As to the plea of unworthiness: are you therefore, because you
are unworthy, as all are in many respects, to abstain altogether
from receiving?&nbsp; Certainly not.&nbsp; You are commanded,
having first considered the nature, object, and end of this holy
Sacrament, to <i>examine</i> yourself, whether you are desirous
to perform the will of God, and to render him an acceptable
service; and <i>so</i> to communicate.&nbsp; If you thus consider
it, you <i>may have</i> faults, you <i>may</i> fall into error;
but this Sacrament is <i>the appointed </i><a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span><i>method</i>, by which you may hope to obtain pardon
for your faults, and grace to guard you against error for the
time to come.&nbsp; If you say, you are a great sinner, and are
afraid to come; I answer, Even the greatest sinner, <i>if he is
really sorry for the past</i>, <i>and intends to lead a new
life</i>, cannot any where expect to plead for mercy, through the
merits of Christ, better than at his altar, and in the manner
which he has graciously appointed.&nbsp; In short, he that
<i>cometh not</i> at all, is in a no less dangerous state, than
he who cometh <i>unworthily</i>; that is, who comes, <i>resolving
to continue</i> in his sin; the former, <i>because he uses
not</i> his best remedy against sin; the latter, because <i>he
abuses it</i>; and both, while in that state, must fall short of
the glory of God.</p>
<p>Now, observing, as I do, your great anxiety to do all the good
to your fellow-creatures, that you have it in your power to
perform; and believing that you thus act from no worldly or
ostentatious motives, but in obedience to the <i>will of God</i>,
the only true and solid principle of action in the breast of a
sincere Christian; and observing also, that you attend the public
services of religion, at least one day in a week; I am convinced
that you cannot live in the <i>habits</i> of vice, or in the
<i>unrestrained indulgence</i> of any wilful sin.&nbsp; If I am
right, and you have only been subject to <i>occasional</i> lapses
from a virtuous course of life, the effect of a <i>sudden
surprise</i>, or <i>violent temptation</i>, that is the very
reason <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>why
you should come to the Lord&rsquo;s table; because if you
earnestly desire to conquer that vice, whatever it be, which most
easily besets you, and come with an honest heart, and sincere
purposes of amendment; it is our comfort, in the midst of our
imperfections, that our God expects no more from us, than he will
enable us to perform; and that even as a father pitieth his own
children, so will the Lord be merciful unto them that fear him;
<i>for he knoweth whereof we are made</i>, <i>he remembereth that
we are but dust</i>. <a name="citation13a"></a><a
href="#footnote13a" class="citation">[13a]</a>&nbsp; But while he
is thus merciful and gracious, he does expect <i>this</i>; that
we be sincere in what we profess, and <i>that we go to him for
help by those ways and ordinances</i>, which he has mercifully
vouchsafed to afford us, as our comfort in this life, and our
guide to everlasting happiness.&nbsp; Still, I hear you persist
in expressing your fears, lest, after having received this
blessed food, you should <i>relapse</i> into sin.&nbsp; Probably
you may; and so have the best of men that have lived before
you.&nbsp; But I am convinced of this (supposing you not to be an
<i>habitual</i> sinner), that the <i>oftener</i> you attend this
holy Sacrament, purposing to amend your life, and to walk from
thenceforth in God&rsquo;s holy ways, though you should still
<i>occasionally</i> fall, the less and less frequent will those
relapses be, till they <i>altogether</i> cease; <a
name="citation13b"></a><a href="#footnote13b"
class="citation">[13b]</a> and be assured, that he who, <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>with pious
diffidence, <i>forces</i> himself, as it were, to approach that
table in obedience to God&rsquo;s will, and because he finds
that, <i>without it</i>, he is unable to cleanse his way, is
better prepared than he is aware of.&nbsp; <i>Come unto me all ye
that travail</i>, <i>and are heavy laden</i> (<i>with the burden
of your sins</i>), <i>and I will give you rest</i>, <a
name="citation14"></a><a href="#footnote14"
class="citation">[14]</a> is Christ&rsquo;s gracious invitation
and promise to sinners.&nbsp; And if you desire to be relieved
from such occasional relapses, you ought, undoubtedly, to obey
this merciful call; for the denunciations against the unworthy
reception of this Sacrament, apply to those, who, at the moment
of receiving, not only have not forsaken their sins, but are
<i>continuing</i> in the <i>wilful and habitual</i> commission of
<i>known</i> sins.</p>
<p>But another argument on this subject overpowers <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>me with its
weight; and I trust, my dear friend, it will produce a similar
effect on you.&nbsp; I know you would be greatly shocked, as I
should be, to be told, that we were unfit to approach our Maker,
in the ordinary devotions of the closet, or to join our fellow
Christians in the daily service of the church.&nbsp; And yet it
is your duty and mine to consider (what is most certainly true),
that <i>every act of religion</i>, whether public or private,
<i>requires the same dispositions of mind</i>, namely, repentance
of past sins, and purposes of future amendment, as the
celebration of the Sacrament.&nbsp; No man is fit to approach the
throne of God in that divine form of prayer which Christ himself
hath taught us, or in any other, if he is then living in
<i>habitual</i> violation of his laws; for that is to pray with
his lips, while his heart is far from God; and this we know is
declared to be mockery in his sight.&nbsp; <i>Praying
unworthily</i>, that is, without reverence and godly fear, and
whilst we live in the love and <i>habitual</i> indulgence of any
known and deliberate sin, will be equally offensive to the eye of
spotless Purity, as unworthily communicating.&nbsp; If this
reflection were duly attended to, men would discover, that the
common excuses alleged for non-attendance at the altar, if
pursued through all their consequences, would necessarily lead to
the casting off every branch of social and private worship. <a
name="citation15"></a><a href="#footnote15"
class="citation">[15]</a>&nbsp; Do not imagine <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>that I seek
to depreciate this sacred ordinance, or to lessen the reverence
due to it; for I readily admit, that whoever is <i>determined to
indulge in the practice of known sins</i>, <i>and to persevere in
a wicked course of life</i>, ought not to come to the table of
the Lord: but I most earnestly entreat you (if <i>you are</i>
such a one, as I trust you are not) to consider the danger of
your state: to such a one I say, If you are not fit to receive
the Sacrament, you are not fit to pray; and, oh horrible thought!
you are not fit to die.&nbsp; So far am I from depreciating this
blessed institution, that I wish it to be universally regarded,
and resorted to by all Christians, as the best means of grace,
and a pledge to assure us of God&rsquo;s favour to his people:
but I am also desirous to convince you, that reverence and
respect are equally required, and a general good life and
virtuous conduct are no less essential to the right performance
of those ordinary duties of prayer and praise, <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>which by too
many are performed in compliance with custom, and regarded as
mere matters of course; whereas there is not one of these duties,
the <i>due performance</i> of which (I repeat this idea for its
importance) does not require the <i>same sorrow</i> for past
sins, the <i>same steadfast purposes of amendment</i>, the
<i>same faith</i> in Christ, and the <i>same charity</i> to men,
as communicating at the holy table.&nbsp; No man is, or can be,
accepted by God, in the performance of any of these duties, who
is not fit to come to the other.&nbsp; No man, <i>who has a just
sense of the nature of this holy Sacrament</i>, <i>who has
sincerely repented of his past sins</i>, <i>who is desirous of
leading a good life</i>, and in general does so, can ever be
unprepared for the Lord&rsquo;s Supper; no man, <i>who leads a
bad life</i>, can ever come <i>properly prepared</i> to that, or
to any other Christian ordinance whatever.&nbsp; As to previous,
<i>special</i> preparation, this is all well, and ought never to
be omitted, where men have opportunities for it; and it is quite
clear that we cannot take too much pains in self-examination, or
in raising our affections to God.&nbsp; But to think that by
these preparations <i>alone we are</i>, and that <i>without
them</i> we <i>cannot be</i> prepared, is a grievous and
dangerous error.&nbsp; Even our <i>preparatory</i>, or our
<i>ordinary</i> prayers, <i>if we hold fast any darling sin</i>,
<i>or adhere to any habitual vice</i>, are an abomination and a
mockery of God.&nbsp; Prayers, <i>when added to a general good
life</i>, are, indeed, an admirable preparation; and nothing can
be depended <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>upon as a security against vice, but a <i>frequent</i>
and <i>reverent</i> reception of the Holy Sacrament, and
endeavouring <i>to live every day</i>, as if we were <i>daily</i>
to communicate.&nbsp; This is the true, this is the only
preparation; and he that with such impressions communicates,
though at a minute&rsquo;s warning, will never be rejected by
Him, who was touched with a feeling of our infirmities.&nbsp; On
the contrary, such a man will find this holy rite to be, what its
all-bountiful Author intended it should be to all faithful
Christians, a support and a comfort in every situation of life;
it will confirm his faith and good resolutions, elevate his
hopes, and increase his charity; it will bring to his mind
assurances of forgiveness and acceptance, in that tremendous
hour, when we are taught most <i>earnestly</i> to pray that no
pains of death may make us fall from God: it will enable him to
support those pains with Christian fortitude, because he will
feel that they are to be his introduction to eternal joy.</p>
<p>A great master in the art of holy living, the most excellent
and pious Bishop Jeremy Taylor, has, in so pointed and convincing
a manner, enforced this duty upon all descriptions of Christians,
and his reasoning so strongly confirms what I have already
advanced, that I cannot deny myself the pleasure of transcribing
the passage.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>All</i> Christian people <i>must</i>
come to this holy supper.&nbsp; They, indeed, that are in a state
of sin must not come so, but yet they <i>must</i> come; first,
they must quit <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>their state of death, and then partake of the bread of
life.&nbsp; <i>They that are at enmity with their neighbours</i>
must come, <i>that</i> is no excuse for their not coming; only
they must not bring their enmity along with them, but <i>leave
it</i>, <i>and then come</i>.&nbsp; <i>They that have a variety
of secular employments</i> must come; only they must leave their
secular thoughts and affections behind them, and <i>then come and
converse with God</i>.&nbsp; If any <i>man be well grown in
grace</i>, <i>he</i> must needs come; because he is excellently
disposed to so holy a feast: <i>but he that is but in the infancy
of piety had need to come</i>, <i>that so he may grow in
grace</i>.&nbsp; The <i>strong</i> must come, lest they become
weak; and the <i>weak</i>, that they may become strong.&nbsp; The
<i>sick</i> must come to be cured, the <i>healthful</i> to be
preserved.&nbsp; <i>They that have leisure</i> must come, because
they have no excuse; <i>they that have no leisure</i> must come
hither, that by so excellent an act of religion they may sanctify
their business.&nbsp; <i>The penitent sinners</i> must come, that
they <i>may</i> be justified; <i>and they that are justified</i>,
<i>that they may be justified still</i>.&rdquo; <a
name="citation19"></a><a href="#footnote19"
class="citation">[19]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such are the arguments, my dear Sir, by which I have convinced
myself of the <i>absolute</i> duty of <i>frequent</i> and
<i>regular</i> communion; and so far am I now from considering
the attendance upon the holy altar as a burden, which one cannot
but fear is the <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>case with too many, I am sensible, that to be
<i>permitted</i> to perform this <i>duty</i> is a <i>high</i> and
<i>inestimable privilege</i>, as well as a duty.&nbsp; I have
now, therefore, myself arrived at this determination, never to
turn my back upon the holy table, when it is prepared for my
reception.&nbsp; From this practice I have derived a peace of
mind, a steadiness of motives to good conduct, and a consolation
under the pressure, both of sorrow for the loss of friends, and
of frequent pain and bodily infirmity; which by the grace of God,
I trust, no worldly considerations could now induce me to
relinquish or forego, by a contrary conduct.</p>
<p>I cannot do better than close what I have to say upon this
most interesting subject, with the conclusion of a sermon, of
one, <a name="citation20"></a><a href="#footnote20"
class="citation">[20]</a> who is as bright a luminary of our
venerable church at this day, as the pious and most excellent
Prelate, whose works I have lately quoted, was in the seventeenth
century.&nbsp; I quote from a sermon preached on this subject, at
the Magdalen Chapel; and if there be any thing in what the devout
preacher has said, applicable to your own case, I trust your good
sense will make and improve the application.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I wish, in conclusion,&rdquo; says this
energetic and pious divine, &ldquo;to draw your attention to a
circumstance of importance, which particularly offers itself to
our notice, <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>both from the subject before us, <i>and the place in
which we now are</i>.&nbsp; They who minister at the altar, are
witnesses of a truth much to be lamented, that very few of <i>our
sex</i>, in comparison with the other, ever are partakers of the
Lord&rsquo;s Supper; and much it is to be feared, that a
<i>determination to proceed in the deliberate commission of that
deadly sin</i>, <i>which fills this house </i><a
name="citation21"></a><a href="#footnote21"
class="citation">[21]</a><i> with woe</i>, is by many made a
reason for neglecting the <i>indispensable duty</i> of receiving
the Holy Sacrament; and they vainly imagine, that, by <i>not</i>
partaking of it, they may sin with a greater chance of
impunity.&nbsp; They assume, moreover, a <i>kind of merit</i> to
themselves in abstaining from it, as if <i>it indicated a
laudable fear of eating and drinking unworthily</i>.&nbsp; Alas!
how much are they mistaken! for let us consider a little.&nbsp;
The Scriptures, that is, the law by which we are all to be judged
at the last day, expressly forbid fornication as a sin, which, if
persevered in, without repentance, will certainly exclude us from
the kingdom of Heaven; and they also command the receiving of the
Holy Sacrament, <i>as a means of obtaining grace and
salvation</i>:&mdash;<i>whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my
blood</i>, saith our Saviour, <i>hath eternal life</i>.&nbsp; Now
imagine, for illustration, that you had a child, in a state
improper to appear before his parents from want, let us say, of
cleanliness in his person; and imagine also, that he is <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>admonished to
make himself ready that he may attend his duty; suppose he
replies, <i>that he is not in a fit state</i>, <i>that he will
not prepare himself</i>, <i>and therefore</i> he cannot perform
the duty enjoined: would you in this case look upon <i>him</i> as
excusable? or would you not rather regard him as deserving
<i>double</i> blame, who knowing what is right, insolently
refuses to perform it, <i>and dares to plead one offence</i>,
<i>as a reason for committing another</i>?&nbsp; It is the same
with respect to yourselves.&nbsp; Your souls, in the sight of
God, are covered with impurity; and he exhorts you to
<i>cleanse</i> yourselves from all filthiness of flesh and
spirit, that you may take this holy Sacrament to your comfort;
and <i>can you be so weak as to suppose</i>, <i>that your
wickedness in the former point will be diminished because you
refuse to listen to your Redeemer in the latter</i>?&nbsp; If
there are any here, to whom what I have now said, is in any
degree applicable; let me entreat them to break off instantly
that fellowship, with which Christ can have no agreement.&nbsp;
<i>Let them remember</i>, <i>that to reject the blood of the
covenant</i>, <i>because they are unworthy</i>, <i>through the
habitual commission of any known sin</i>, <i>is to render that
unworthiness still greater</i>: whilst, on the contrary, to
forsake their sins, that they may seek acceptance with their
Redeemer, is to render that acceptance sure.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I here quit this subject with these most forcible arguments of
my excellent friend; and though you <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>may think I have said too much, yet
if the result shall be, <i>after a careful and attentive
perusal</i>, that you shall become a regular attendant at the
Lord&rsquo;s Table, where I shall have much comfort in meeting
you, your labour in reading, and mine in writing, will be
rewarded by the production of much solid fruit, and, I trust,
endless satisfaction to us both.</p>
<p>With anxious concern for your present and eternal
happiness,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I remain, dear Sir, &amp;c.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">LAICUS.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>.&mdash;I have been much urged
by a valuable friend, to recommend some book of preparation for
this holy rite.&nbsp; But where there are so many good books, it
is difficult to fix upon any one, to the exclusion of
others.&nbsp; My objection to most of these works is, that they
are too long, and many people of weak consciences imagine, that
unless they have gone through the whole course of devotion,
therein prescribed, they are not fit to approach the holy
altar.&nbsp; This is, in my opinion, an unhappy mistake, and
cannot be too soon eradicated.&nbsp; But were I to give a
preference to any books, my own choice would be fixed upon Bishop
Wilson&rsquo;s work, and <i>The Companion to the Altar</i> (and
of these two <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>prefer the latter), which used, and ought always, to be
bound up with the Book of Common Prayer.&nbsp; <i>The Companion
to the Altar</i> is excellent, founded upon the Church Catechism,
and the prayers are complete, without being tedious or
enthusiastic.&nbsp; And if any one wishes to lengthen his
devotions, there is, at the end of each preparatory prayer, a
reference to appropriate Psalms&mdash;and <i>they</i>, to use the
words of the late pious Mr. Jones, of Nayland, as applied by him
to Bishop Horne&rsquo;s beautiful Commentary on these sacred
Songs, will never cease to be the companion of the devout, till
the devotion of earth shall end in the hallelujahs of Heaven.</p>

invitations were given by some of our clergy, in a more solemn
and earnest manner than at all times prevails, and that the whole
Exhortation were read, as it is in many churches in the north of
England.&nbsp; I should think, also, it would be attended with a
very happy effect, which, indeed, I have known to be produced by
it, if notice of the Sacrament were sometimes given by reading
the <i>second</i> Exhortation, addressed &ldquo;<i>to those who
are negligent to come to the Holy Communion</i>;&rdquo; the use
of which, I am afraid, the state of most congregations in this
country will fully warrant.&nbsp; And if, after using either of
these Exhortations, the kind and affectionate Pastor would in the
course of his sermon pathetically and earnestly entreat his
congregation to attend the ensuing Sacrament, to which they have
just been invited, as they value their soul&rsquo;s health,
occasionally explaining any difficulty or scruple that may be
likely to affect ordinary or young minds upon a part of the first
Exhortation, I am confident the happiest effects would frequently
follow.</p>

make him leave off sinning, or his sinning will make him leave
off praying.&rdquo; <a name="citation13c"></a><a

Sacraments</i>, <i>being in charity with all men</i>, and we may
venture to predict, that religion will soon get the mastery over
such a man&rsquo;s worldly and sinful dispositions, and that,
through the merits and atonement of Christ, his salvation is
secure.</p>

exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
